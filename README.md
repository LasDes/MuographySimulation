Title: Geant4 Muography Simulation

Authors: Christian Perez

Created: 01/18/2021


This is the first attempt at building a Geant4 application from scratch instead of copying from built examples. The goal is to develop an accurate simulation of the parallel plate detectors in the lab setting as well as application environments such as mountains, atmosphere, or other structures.
